# About

	This script will pull DefensePro attack details through Vision/CyberController and from DP directly. It uses these details to generate a user-friendly report.

# Prerequisites

	This script requires the requests, paramiko, and pysftp libraries. 'pip install requests paramiko pysftp' to download them.
	You will need to know your Vision/CC username, password and root password.
	DefensePro version at least 8.32
	DefensePro must have BDOS attack lifecycle logging enabled: 'system internal security bdos attack-log-status set enable'. 'Unknown command' means your DefensePro must be upgraded.

# How to run
	The script can be run in four modes:
		- Interactive (without command line arguments)
		- Automated, using command line arguments and cached settings from previous runs
		- Automated, using a json list for the arguments
		- Manually Collected Files from Cyber Controller (Tech support and forensics)
	
	Optional:
		Config.ini is automatically generated during the script's first execution. It contains multiple customizations that can improve the final product. These include:
			Customizable report lengths
			Automatically emailed Reports
			Integrate IP Reputation and geolocation data from ipqualityscore.com and/or abuseipdb.com
			Exclude attack types

	Without Arguments:
		1. Run the script 
			python main.py
		2. Enter Vision/CC login credentials
		3. Enter start and end times
		4. (optional - press enter to skip) Select target DPs 
		5. (optional - press enter to skip) Enter a comma separated list of policies for each DP.
		6. View your report under .\Output\

	With Arguments:
		1. Run the script with the -h argument for details.
			python main.py -h

		At the time of updating this section of the readme (19 September 2025), the output of python main.py -h is:
			Script syntax:
			python main.py [--environment <name>] [--offline | --use-cached | <Vision_IP Username Password RootPassword>] <Time-Range> <DefensePro-list> <First-DP-policy-list> <Second-DP-policy-list> <X-DP-policy-list>...
				***Note: The order of arguments is important and must not deviate from the above template.***
				--environment, -e      Optional: Specify an environment. This is used for output naming. Script will use 'Default' if not specified.
				--offline, -o         Instead of connecting to a live Vision appliance, use cached data stored in ./Temp/ for generating DP-Attack-Analyzer_Report.html
				--use-cached, -c      Use information stored in 'config.ini' for Vision IP, username, and password
				<time-range> options:
					--hours, -h <number_of_hours>                      Select data from the past X hours.
					--date-range, -dr <start_datetime> <end_datetime>  Select data between two specified dates.
					--epoch-range, -er <epoch_start> <epoch_end>       Select data between two Unix epoch times.
					--previous-time-range, -p                          Use the cached time range from the last time the script was run.
				<defensepro-list>     Comma-separated list of DefensePro names or IP addresses (use '' for all).
				<policy-list>         Comma-separated list of policy names (use '' for all).
			Examples:
				python main.py -c --hours 3 DefensePro1,DefensePro2,192.168.1.20 DefensePro1_BdosProfile,DefensePro1_SynFloodProtection DP2_BdosProfile,DP2_SynFloodProtection DP3_Policy1
				python main.py 192.168.1.1 admin radware radware1 --epoch-range 859885200 859971600 '' ''
				python main.py --use-cached --date-range "11 Oct 2024 09:00:00" "11 Oct 2024 18:00:00" "DP1, DP2" "DP1_Policy1, DP1_Policy2" "DP2_Policy1, DP2_Policy2"

		** These arguments are subject to change. Don't trust the list on this page. They are only listed here to give you an idea of what options are available. **

		JSON launcher:
			The purpose of the json launcher is to run the script against multiple predefined environments in quick succession. It is run by calling 'python json_launcher.py'.
			json_launcher.py will automatically execute main.py with parameters based on the contents of launcher.json

			launcher.json format: 
				At it's top level it is a list. Each element contains a dictionary representing a separate execution of main.py [execution1details, execution2details, etc]
				The elements of each dictionary are:
					"environment" - String defining the environment name to be used for naming output files.
					"use_cached" - Boolean that identifies if cached credentials in config.ini should be used.
					"vision_ip", "vision_username", "vision_password", "vision_root_password" - Strings defining vision connection info.
					"time_range" - Dictionary containing two elements:
						"type" - String identifying the time range type. --hours, --date-range, --epoch-range, --previous-time-range are acceptable values. See 'main.py -h' for details.
						"value" - Varieant based on type specified. If selected type requires multiple inputs, place them in a list [StartTime, Endtime]
					"defensepros_policies" - Dictionary containing "defensepro" : "policies" pairs. Input a single space for the policy name to select 'All'
				See the included launcher.json.example for a sample.
		
		Manually Collected Files (Tech support and forensics):
			1. Collect a techsupport file and a forensics report from one or more defensepro appliances.
			2. Place the TechSupport .tgz and Forensics .zip files in the ./Manual/ folder
			3. Run the script with the '--manually-collected' or '-m' flag. Ex: 'python.exe main.py --manually-collected'
